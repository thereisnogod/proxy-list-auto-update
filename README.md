# For some reason, GitHub turned off Actions for me, so there won't be any updates yet. To get proxies yourself, use the [proxy-scraper-checker](https://github.com/monosans/proxy-scraper-checker).

[![Update proxies](https://github.com/monosans/proxy-list/actions/workflows/action.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/monosans/proxy-list/actions/workflows/action.yml)

Proxies are scraped and checked every ~15 minutes using [proxy-scraper-checker](https://github.com/monosans/proxy-scraper-checker) since 19-06-2021.

Every proxy's entry-node and exit-node are IPv4.
